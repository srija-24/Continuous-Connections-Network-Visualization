# Continuous-Connections-Network-Visualization
Python network visualization tool using Tkinter and Folium for real-time mapping of computer connections. Geopy for geocoding. Features dynamic paths, multimedia elements, and live updates for an interactive user experience.
Continuous Connections is a Python-based network visualization tool that enables real-time mapping of computer connections. The application, developed using Tkinter and Folium, offers a user-friendly interface for inputting computer locations and connections.

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization:** Dynamic paths on an interactive map provide a live representation of computer network connections.

- **Geocoding:** Utilizes Geopy to convert location names into geographic coordinates for accurate mapping.

- **Multimedia Integration:** Features a splash screen with an embedded video and background music using Pygame.

- **Multi-Threading:** Efficiently handles simultaneous processes, ensuring smooth execution.

## Usage

1. Run the application using Python.
2. Enter the number of computers and their connections.
3. Explore the dynamic map visualization in real-time.

## Dependencies
